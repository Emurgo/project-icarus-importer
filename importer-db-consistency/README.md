# `cardano-sl-importer-db-consistency`

Checks the consistency of the postgres db generated by the `cardano-sl-blockchain-importer` internally (with it's rocks db) and externally (with the db of a Cardano node).

The following checks were carried out (and should be re-done periodically):
- Check the internal consistency of the staging and mainnet dbs (using `importet-db-consistency/scripts/launch/internal-consistency.sh`).
- Check the internal consistency of the db upon restart (using `importer-db-consistency/scripts/launch/internal-consistency.sh`).
- Check the consistency of an up-to-date db with the one of an up-to-date Cardano node (using `importer-db-consistency/scripts/launch/external-consistency-from-blk.sh`).

The results and configurations used for the scripts can be seen in `importer-db-consistency/scripts/launch/staging-test-results.txt` and `importer-db-consistency/scripts/launch/mainnet-test-results.txt`.
